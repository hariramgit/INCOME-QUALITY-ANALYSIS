# INCOME-QUALITY-ANALYSIS

## Problem Scenario:
Many social programs have a hard time ensuring that the right people are given enough aid. It‚Äôs tricky when a program focuses on the poorest segment of the population. This segment of the population can‚Äôt provide the necessary income and expense records to prove that they qualify.

In Latin America, a popular method called Proxy Means Test (PMT) uses an algorithm to verify income qualification. With PMT, agencies use a model that considers a family‚Äôs observable household attributes like the material of their walls and ceiling or the assets found in their homes to
classify them and predict their level of need.

While this is an improvement, accuracy remains a problem as the region‚Äôs population grows and poverty declines

The Inter-American Development Bank (IDB)believes that new methods beyond traditional econometrics, based on a dataset of Costa Rican household characteristics, might help improve PMT‚Äôs performance.


## we are permorming the Following steps:

- Identify the output variable.
- Understand the type of data.
- Check if there are any biases in your dataset.
- Check whether all members of the house have the same poverty level.
- Check if there is a house without a family head.
- Set poverty level of the members and the head of the house within a family.
- Count how many null values are existing in columns.
- Remove null value rows of the target variable.
- Predict the accuracy using random forest classifier.
- Check the accuracy using random forest with cross validation.
